# SERVICES

- background process , running always , daemon , often end with letter "d"
- child process , spawned as a result of a request by a parent program
    + super servers , listen for user requests and spawn services accordingly
        - inetd , internet daemon for Linux
        - xinetd , additional features (ACLs, schedule services, advanced loggin)

> *ip , reach the server / port , reach the services*

## LOCAL SERVICES

    file servers
        peer-to-peer
        client-server

        - NFS *network file system protocol* **nfs-utils**
        - samba *opensource implementation of Mincrosoft's system message block protocol*
    
    print servers
        - CUPS *common unix printing system* uses IPP *internet printing protocol*
    
    network resource servers
        IP addresses
            server packages
                - dhcpd
            client packages
                - dhclient
                - dhcpcd
                - pump
        
        Logging servers
            - rsyslogd *accept logging data from remote servers*
            - journald *accept local and remote system logging data*

        name servers
            - named *BIND software package* provide dns services
        
        network management
            - net-snmp *SNMPv3 compatible*
            
            SNMP    - simple auth / plain text
            SNMPv2  - more secure / bulk data transfer
            SNMPv3  - strong auth / encryption
        
        time servers
            - ntpd *uses NTP network time protocol*

## SECURITY SERVICES

    authentication
        - nis-utils *uses NIS network information system*
        - kerberos *uses symetric key cyptography*
        - openLDAP *uses LDAP lightweight directory access protocol*
        - openSSL *uses certificates to authenticate*
            certificate is an encrypted key to implement two factor security
                + something possesed - certificate file
                + something known - pin
            certificate authority issues the certificate
        - openSSH *uses SSH secure shell*
            openSSH supports a fearture called tunneling allowing encrypting any network transaction
            which helps to encrypt insecure traffic even when the network application does not support
            encryption directly. ie, Telnet
        - openVPN *uses VPN virtual private network protocol*
    
    proxy
        - squid *filter and caching service*
        - nginX
    
    monitoring
        - Nagios software package *uses SNMP*
